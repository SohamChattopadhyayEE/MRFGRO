# Covid-19 detection with MRFGRO 
This repository consists of two files: 1. Feature Extraction and 2. Optimization algorithm
#### 1. Feature extraction: 
In this file there are two .py files, named FeatureExtractionByGoogLeNet.py  and FeatureExtractionByResNet18.py. The first .py file extracts the last layer deep features of GoogleNet pretrained network, trained on respective datasets mentioned in the paper (For an example we have lets's consider Sars-Cov-2 dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BqGGz99QlahCOnXMMeiHqVoVp5E2Dhod?usp=sharing). From there we get 1024 deep features (Link of CSV : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-I-qi0ZLoRiaqe5k-mwhCrQ3WeYaFDhE/view?usp=sharing). The second .py file in Feature extraction folder consists of the features from the last layer of ResNet 18. Number of features we get in this stage is 512 (Link of the CSV: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--Zt6X7fTlKkREUyiXU87iODku-7MS58/view?usp=sharing). After that we concatenated the two feature set and total (1024+512) features (Link of the CSV: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cck0-2PRs2QvW1RTV27EewJaTmRo1-kR/view?usp=sharing) are fed into the optimiztion algorithm.
#### 2. Optimization algorithm: 
In this file there is a .py file named MRFGRO(modified).py, which consists of a hybridisation of MRFO and GRO optimization algorithm.
